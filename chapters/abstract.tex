\chapter*{Abstract}

This Final Engineering Project proposes the development of a predictive web platform for inventory management in gastronomic establishments in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The main objective is to optimize inventory stock in gastronomic SMEs by 2025 by predicting sales based on a machine learning model, reducing economic losses due to overstocking or shortages, and improving operational efficiency.

The proposal consists of a web platform aimed at gastronomic SMEs, which integrates sales data from platforms like PedidosYa and uses machine learning models to estimate future demand. Unlike existing commercial solutions in the Argentine market, the system allows the incorporation of external variables (weather, holidays) and user feedback to adjust its predictions.
